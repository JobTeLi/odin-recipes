    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This <em>corn ribs</em> method takes your usual BBQ corn on the cob,
        combines it with <em>Mexican street corn</em>, and decides to give it a little make-over.
        Quarter the corn lengthways, season/marinade, and then cook. During the cooking process,
        the corn curls up slightly and resembled the curved rib shape, i.e., <em>‘corn riblets.’</em></p>
