    <h1>Corn-Ribs</h1>
    <img class="cornribs" src="../img/cornribs.jpeg" alt="Delicious lookin Corn Ribs spiced and curled with green cilantro on top.">
    <h2 class="recipe-header">Description</h2>
    <p>This <em>corn ribs</em> method takes your usual BBQ corn on the cob,
        combines it with <em>Mexican street corn</em>,</p> <p>and decides to give it a little make-over.
        Quarter the corn lengthways, season/marinade, and then cook.</p> <p></p>During the cooking process,
        the corn curls up slightly and resembled the curved rib shape, i.e., <em>‘corn riblets.’</em></p>
    <p class="prep"><strong>Preperation time:</strong> 30 minutes</p>
    <h2 class="recipe-header">Ingredients</h2> 
    <p><ul><li>Corn on the cob 2</li>
           <li>Smoked paprika 1/2 tsp</li>
           <li>Garlic powder 1/2 tsp</li>
           <li>Pepper 1/4 tsp</li>
           <li>Salt (coarse) 1/4 tsp</li>
           <li>Olive oil</li>
           <li>Mayonaise</li>
           <li>Sriracha</li>
           <li>Limes</li>
           <li>cilantro</li>
    </ul></p>   
    <h2 class="recipe-header">Steps</h2>
    <p><ol><li>Chop the corn in riblets, stand it up vertically
        with the wider part against the table and chop in half,
         then chop those halves into quarters. Keep your hands above the knife.</li>
           <li>Prepare the seasoning by combining all of the spices
            and oil in a small bowl and mix well. Then brush the seasoning over 
            the chopped corn.</li>
           <li>Cooking the corn ribs. For air frying: lay the corn ribs in a single layer
            in your air fryer basket, with a little space between each so the air can flow.
            cook the corn in an air fryer at 375F/190C for 12-15 minutes, optionally
            flipping them over at 7 minutes. If you prefer crispier results, then cook for the longest time (15).
            For oven-baked: Lay the seasoned corn on a parchement-lined baking tray and bake in a preheated oven at 375F/190C 
            for between 25-30 minutes. For more curl increase time.
            For regular Fries: If you plan to fry the corn, then dont season them first - add the plain chopped corn to the oil.
            When the corn starts to curl, remove them from the oil and put them on kitchen paper to drain.
            and then gently toss the corn with the dry seasoning mixture (no oil required).</li>
           <li>Meanwhile, as the sweetcorn cooks, prepare the sriracha mayonaise and garnishes. Once baked,
            top and serve!</li>
