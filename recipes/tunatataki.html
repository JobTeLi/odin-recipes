    <p>Today we make <em>tataki from tuna</em>. Tataki sounds like an ingredient,
        but it's not. It's a way of cooking from Japanese kitchen where
        meat or fish is served almost raw. This can only be achieved with
        fresh meat or fish that is suitable for raw consumption. The tataki
        of tuna comes with <em>wasabi-mayonaise</em>, <em>sweet-sour cucumber rolls</em>, <em>Eastern vinaigrette</em>
        and <em>sweet Eastern onions</em>.</p>
